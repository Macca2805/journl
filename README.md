# JNN - Journl News Network
Sample project utilising the news feed from https://thewest.com.au/.

## Setup / Technical Notes
- Bootstrapped using create-react-app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Hosted on GitHub pages using the gh-pages package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages).

## Things to work on
- Deep linking does not work. I cannot browse directly to an article (ie. http://macklin.me/journl/article/B88777531Z).
- I'd like to support more of the features of the API like video given more time. Video would be an interesting opportunity to play around an experimental layout.
- I want to put some light animations in for page loading and transitions.
- The project uses SCSS but I don't care for the way its setup in create-react-app. Solution might come from trying a CSS-in-JS framework.
